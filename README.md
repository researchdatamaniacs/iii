## Open questions
~ Building out public innovation data layers  

~ Encapsulating an sharing code   (Singularity)  

~ Full experimental / datset context (Working with the Whole Tale Project) 

~ Support for MyBinder (global binderhub) - https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/how-can-i-support-mybinder-org/4692/4
